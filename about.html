      <p>
        I am the posterboy for journeys. Started in engineering, then moved to writing technical copy for a crypto company, and now settled in the world of creative copy and concepting. This was my internal journey, from the left part of my brain to the right.
      </p>

      <p>
        Born in Kolkata, worked remotely for companies in Texas and Wyoming, and then moved to Berlin, and then Hamburg, and Milan, and Dusseldorf, and Amsterdam. This was my external journey.
      </p>

      <p>
        This need to always keep moving, trying new things, and learning new things meant that I could only make a living out of being in advertising or as a pilot. And being scared of heights made that choice for me.
      </p>

      <p>
        So I live vicariously through every new project thrown my way, learning about swiss dairy cows through one brief, and UK’s phonebooth graveyards through the next.
      </p>

      <p>
        It’s fun, and keeps giving me an excuse to delay getting a pilot’s license. So I think I will stay in this ad world for a while.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you think you have some projects that would keep my journey moving in interesting directions, please get in touch!
